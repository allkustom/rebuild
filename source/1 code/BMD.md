    We maintain your battery in the safest and most reliable way for both productivity and the well-being of every citizen
descriptionContent: 
    As battery technology continues to advance, it is imagined that an “Ultimate Battery” will eventually emerge. It is advanced enough to be implanted into the human body. (Stronger, lighter, smaller, and safer) UTOPIA, such a battery could assist joint movement or support recovery and rehabilitation. -> DYSTOPIA, the nation/government will start to manage increased individual productivity powered by batteries. With the emergence of BMD, all citizens’ battery will be monitored and controlled. If any citizen doesn’t follow BMD’s replacement order, they will get a penalty — This project presents a dystopian experience by visualizing how BMD manages citizens’ battery data and enforces the replacement process through the database and facility.
